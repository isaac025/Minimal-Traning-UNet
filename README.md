# Using SLEAP to identify animal body-parts

This project uses [sleap][https://sleap.ai] to
estimate on datasets body-parts of animals.

## What is SLEAP?
Sleap is a deep-learning framework built in Python.

## Our work

We used SLEAP's UNet architechture and trained it
to estimate the body-parts of flies on a given
dataset.

## Validation
