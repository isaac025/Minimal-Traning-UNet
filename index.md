# Post-estimation on animal Body-Parts using SLEAP

This project uses [the SLEAP](https://sleap.ai) deep-learning framework in order
to train a UNet to estimate on body-parts of animals, in this case of flies.

## What is SLEAP?

SLEAP is a deep-learning framework that is built to estimate body-parts of animals
on a given dataset.

Please visit follow [SLEAP's Tutorial](https://sleap.ai/tutorials/tutorial.html)
to better understand and try them out!

## The notebook

We provide a notebook with multiple functions that help manipulate the dataset
a lot more easier.
The dataset that sleap builds are divided into different images.

For example, we can get the instance image of a video and its
confidence maps (X and Y coordinates of where precisely a body-part
is). The output pictures look like this.

After training, we can get the X and Y coordinates of the confidence
maps generated and compare them to the ground truths. We developed a 
function:
```
def get_indx(list_of_GT, list_of_Pred)
```
that helps us get the X and Y indexes of the confidence
maps. With this we can easily compare them to the ground
truths and see how well our network is performing.
